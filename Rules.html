<h1> The Rules of Chess.</h1>
		 <p> Chess is a strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. Castling is a move involving the king and one of the rooks. It allows the king to move two squares towards a rook on its initial square, and the rook moves to the square next to the king. Castling is subject to specific conditions, including that neither the king nor the rook involved in castling have moved previously, there are no pieces between them, and the squares they move over are not under attack. En passent meaning on passing in french is a special pawn capture that can occur when a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands next to an opponent's pawn. The opponent can capture the moving pawn as if it had only moved one square forward. White moves first, followed by Black. The game is won by checkmating the opponent's king, i.e. threatening it with inescapable capture. There are also several ways to draw in a game meaning there is no win or loss for either player. </p>

    <tr>
        <td><img class="Moves" src="Images/Pawn.png" width="240" height="240" alt=""></td>
        <td><h2>Pawns:</h2><div style="max-width: 320px">Pawns are the smallest but most numerous pieces on the chessboard, typically starting the game in a line in front of the other pieces. They move forward one square at a time, but on their first initial move, pawns have the option to move forward two squares. Pawns do not capture the piece in front of them, instead, they capture diagonally. Pawns are unique in that they promote to more powerful pieces if they successfully reach the opposite side of the board. Their initial moves often determine the opening strategy, as they control the center and create opportunities for other pieces.</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img class="Moves" src="Images/Rook.png" width="240" height="240" alt=""></td>
        <td><h2>Rooks:</h2><div style="max-width: 320px">Rooks are powerful pieces that move horizontally or vertically across the board, covering ranks and files with ease. They are particularly valuable in the endgame, where they can control open files and contribute to pawn promotion. Rooks are often used to control the board's center during the opening, and they play a crucial role in coordinating with other pieces to launch decisive attacks.</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img class="Moves" src="Images/Knight.png" width="240" height="240" alt=""></td>
        <td><h2>Knights:</h2><div style="max-width:320px">Knights are recognized by their distinct L-shaped move, two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that. They are the only pieces that can "jump" over other pieces, making them effective for circumventing blocked paths and launching surprise attacks. Knights are particularly valuable in the opening and middle game for their ability to control central squares and forking opponent's pieces.</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img class="Moves" src="Images/Bishop.png" width="240" height="240" alt=""></td>
        <td><h2>Bishops:</h2><div style="max-width: 320px">Bishops move diagonally across the board, and each player starts with two—one on a light square and one on a dark square. They excel in open positions where they can control long diagonals, often becoming powerful assets in the endgame. Bishops are most effective when working together to control the board's entire diagonal network, complementing the strengths of other pieces.</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img class="Moves" src="Images/Queen.png" width="240" height="240" alt=""/></td>
		<td><h2>The Queen:</h2><div style="max-width: 320px">The queen is the most powerful piece on the chessboard, capable of moving horizontally, vertically, or diagonally across any number of squares. With her versatility, the queen can dominate the board and launch devastating attacks or defend crucial positions. Early deployment of the queen can lead to aggressive play, but it also carries the risk of leaving her vulnerable to attack if not properly protected.</div></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><img class="Moves" src="Images/TheKing.png" width="240" height="240" alt=""/></td>
		<td><h2>The King:</h2><div style="max-width: 320px">The king is the most important piece, but paradoxically, one of the weakest in terms of mobility and offensive capability. It can move one square in any direction and is primarily focused on safety and protection. Keeping the king safe is paramount, often involving castling to move it to a more secure position behind a wall of pawns. In the endgame, the king becomes more active, often participating in the final stages of the game to support pawns in their journey towards promotion.</div></td>
